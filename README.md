I am a web developer and occasional graphic designer who specialises in designing brand indentities and rebuilding brands.I create usable products and value on digital platforms, by crafting tools and compelling experiences.I also have experience with Search Engine Optimazation and Online Marketing. I am enthusiastic about new opportunities to learn things that i do not know, which i think is a good trait i have so that i am always pushing myself to do better, i work well both independently or as part of a team.I can manage multiple projects in a fast-paced, deadline-driven environment. I have a keen interest in technology, mobile applications and user experience.I wish to expand my skills on a daily basis with the help of an employee focused company.
